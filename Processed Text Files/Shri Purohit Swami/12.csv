0,"“Arjuna asked: My Lord! Which are the better devotees who worship You, those who try to know You as a Personal God, or those who worship You as Impersonal and Indestructible? "
1," Lord Shri Krishna replied: Those who keep their minds fixed on Me, who worship Me always with unwavering faith and concentration; these are the very best. "
2," Those who worship Me as the Indestructible, the Undefinable, the Omnipresent, the Unthinkable, the Primeval, the Immutable and the Eternal; "
3," Subduing their senses, viewing all conditions of life with the same eye, and working for the welfare of all beings, assuredly they come to Me. "
4," But they who thus fix their attention on the Absolute and Impersonal encounter greater hardships, for it is difficult for those who possess a body to realise Me as without one. "
5," Verily, those who surrender their actions to Me, who muse on Me, worship Me and meditate on Me alone, with no thought save of Me, "
6," O Arjuna! I rescue them from the ocean of life and death, for their minds are fixed on Me. "
7," Then let your mind cling only to Me, let your intellect abide in Me; and without doubt you shall live hereafter in Me alone. "
8," But if you can not fix your mind firmly on Me, then, My beloved friend, try to do so by constant practice. "
9," And if you are not strong enough to practise concentration, then devote yourself to My service, do all yours acts for My sake, and you shall still attain the goal. "
10," And if you are too weak even for this, then seek refuge in union with Me, and with perfect self-control renounce the fruit of your action. "
11," Knowledge is superior to blind action, meditation to mere knowledge, renunciation of the fruit of action to meditation, and where there is renunciation peace will follow. "
12," He who is incapable of hatred towards any being, who is kind and compassionate, free from selfishness, without pride, equable in pleasure and in pain, and forgiving, "
13," Always contented, self-centred, self-controlled, resolute, with mind and reason dedicated to Me, such a devotee of Mine is My beloved. "
14," He who does not harm the world, and whom the world cannot harm, who is not carried away by any impulse of joy, anger or fear, such a one is My beloved. "
15," He who expects nothing, who is pure, watchful, indifferent, unruffled, and who renounces all initiative, such a one is My beloved. "
16," He who is beyond joy and hate, who neither laments nor desires, to whom good and evil fortunes are the same, such a one is My beloved. "
17," He to whom friend and foe are alike, who welcomes equally honour and dishonour, heat and cold, pleasure and pain, who is enamoured of nothing, "
18," Who is indifferent to praise and censure, who enjoys silence, who is contented with every fate, who has no fixed abode, who is steadfast in mind, and filled with devotion, such a one is My beloved. "
19," Verily those who love the spiritual wisdom as I have taught, whose faith never fails, and who concentrate their whole nature on Me, they indeed are My most beloved.” "
