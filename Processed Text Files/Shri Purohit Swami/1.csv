0,"The King Dhritarashtra asked: “O Sanjaya! What happened on the sacred battlefield of Kurukshetra, when my people gathered against the Pandavas?” "
1," Sanjaya replied: “The Prince Duryodhana, when he saw the army of the Pandavas paraded, approached his preceptor Guru Drona and spoke as follows: "
2," Revered Father! Behold this mighty host of the Pandavas, paraded by the son of King Drupada, your wise disciple. "
3," In it are heroes and great bowmen; the equals in battle of Arjuna and Bheema, Yuyudhana, Virata and Drupada, great soldiers all; "
4," Dhrishtaketu, Chekitan, the valiant King of Benares, Purujit, Kuntibhoja, Shaibya – a master over many; "
5," Yudhamanyu, Uttamouja, Soubhadra and the sons of Droupadi, famous men. "
6," Further, take note of all those captains who have ranged themselves on our side, O best of Spiritual Guides! The leaders of my army. I will name them for you. "
7," You come first; then Bheeshma, Karna, Kripa, great soldiers; Ashwaththama, Vikarna and the son of Somadhatta; "
8," And many others, all ready to die for my sake; all armed, all skilled in war. "
9," Yet our army seems the weaker, though commanded by Bheeshma; their army seems the stronger, though commanded by Bheema. "
10," Therefore in the rank and file, let stand firm in their posts, according to battalions; and all you generals about Bheeshma. "
11," Then to enliven his spirits, the brave Grandfather Bheeshma, eldest of the Kuru-clan, blew his conch, till it sounded like a lion’s roar. "
12," And immediately all the conches and drums, the trumpets and horns, blared forth in tumultuous uproar. "
13," Then seated in their spacious war chariot, yoked with white horses, Lord Shri Krishna and Arjuna sounded their divine shells. "
14," Lord Shri Krishna blew his Panchajanya and Arjuna his Devadatta, brave Bheema his renowned shell, Poundra. "
15," The King Dharmaraja, the son of Kunti, blew the Anantavijaya, Nakalu and Sahadeo, the Sugosh and Manipushpaka, respectively. "
16," And the Maharaja of Benares, the great archer, Shikhandi, the great soldier, Dhrishtayumna, Virata and Satyaki, the invincible, "
17," And O King! Drupada, the sons of Droupadi and Soubhadra, the great soldier, blew their conches. "
18," The tumult rent the hearts of the sons of Dhritarashtra, and violently shook heaven and earth with its echo. "
19," Then beholding the sons of Dhritarashtra, drawn up on the battle- field, ready to fight, Arjuna, whose flag bore the Hanuman, "
20," Raising his bow, spoke this to the Lord Shri Krishna: O Infallible! Lord of the earth! Please draw up my chariot between the two armies, "
21," So that I may observe those who must fight on my side, those who must fight against me; "
22," And gaze over this array of soldiers, eager to please the sinful sons of Dhritarashtra.” "
23," Sanjaya said: “Having listened to the request of Arjuna, Lord Shri Krishna drew up His bright chariot exactly in the midst between the two armies, "
24," Where Bheeshma and Drona had led all the rulers of the earth, and spoke thus: O Arjuna! Behold these members of the family of Kuru assembled. "
25," There Arjuna noticed fathers, grandfathers, uncles, cousins, sons, grandsons, teachers, friends; "
26," Fathers-in-law and benefactors, arrayed on both sides. Arjuna then gazed at all those kinsmen before him. "
27," And his heart melted with pity and sadly he spoke: O my Lord! When I see all these, my own people, thirsting for battle, "
28," My limbs fail me and my throat is parched, my body trembles and my hair stands on end. "
29," The bow Gandeeva slips from my hand, and my skin burns. I cannot keep quiet, for my mind is in tumult. "
30, The omens are adverse; what good can come from the slaughter of my people on this battlefield? 
31," Ah my Lord! I crave not for victory, nor for the kingdom, nor for any pleasure. What were a kingdom or happiness or life to me, "
32, When those for whose sake I desire these things stand here about to sacrifice their property and their lives: 
33," Teachers, fathers and grandfathers, sons and grandsons, uncles, father-in-law, brothers-inlaw and other relatives. "
34," I would not kill them, even for three worlds; why then for this poor earth? It matters not if I myself am killed. "
35, My Lord! What happiness can come from the death of these sons of Dhritarashtra? We shall sin if we kill these desperate men. 
36," We are worthy of a nobler feat than to slaughter our relatives – the sons of Dhritarashtra; for, my Lord, how can we be happy of we kill our kinsmen? "
37," Although these men, blinded by greed, see no guilt in destroying their kin, or fighting against their friends "
38," Should not we, whose eyes are open, who consider it to be wrong to annihilate our house, turn away from so great a crime? "
39," The destruction of our kindred means the destruction of the traditions of our ancient lineage, and when these are lost, irreligion will overrun our homes. "
40," When irreligion spreads, the women of the house begin to stray; when they lose their purity, adulteration of the stock follows. "
41," Promiscuity ruins both the family and those who defile it; while the souls of our ancestors droop, through lack of the funeral cakes and ablutions. "
42," By the destruction of our lineage and the pollution of blood, ancient class traditions and family purity alike perish. "
43," The wise say, my Lord, that they are forever lost, whose ancient traditions are lost. "
44," Alas, it is strange that we should be willing to kill our own countrymen and commit a great sin, in order to enjoy the pleasures of a kingdom. "
45," If, on the contrary, the sons of Dhritarashtra, with weapons in their hand, should slay me, unarmed and unresisting, surely that would be better for my welfare!” "
46," Sanjaya said: “Having spoken thus, in the midst of the armies, Arjuna sank on the seat of the chariot, casting away his bow and arrow; heartbroken with grief.” "
